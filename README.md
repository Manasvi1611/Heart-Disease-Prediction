# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this study, an effective heart disease prediction system (EHDPS) is developed using neural network for predicting the risk level of heart disease. The system uses 15 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction. The EHDPS predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. It enables significant knowledge, eg, relationships between medical factors related to heart disease and patterns, to be established. We have employed the multilayer perceptron neural network with backpropagation as the training algorithm. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.
